      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        You don't need to worry about the whereabouts of your private
        information when you're searching for travel inspiration or planning
        your next adventure or making a booking of your choice. That's why we're
        committed to protecting the personal information you share with us - and
        why we've created this notice. It tells you who we are, the ways we
        collect your information, what we do with it, and who we share it with.
      </p>
      <h3>Who we are?</h3>
      <p>
        PakiTours is based in Attock, Pakistan. PakiTours is a travel related
        website and aims to become Pakistan's number one travel guide and
        booking portal in future. We show the renowned tourist spots of Pakistan
        to the world along with the hidden beauties in different parts of
        Pakistan.
      </p>
      <h3>Your information - how we collect it, what we collect, and why</h3>
      <p>We collect information about you when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          you give it to us or one of the companies in our group (for example,
          when you sign up to receive our emails or create a profile on our
          website)
        </li>
        <li>
          you post content in our products and services or via our social media
          accounts
        </li>
        <li>
          Sometimes automatically (for example, technical information that
          transfers when you view our sites or applications on your phone or
          computer).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We explain each of these in more detail below, but to be clear,
        PakiTours does not, and will not, sell information about you to anyone.
        We only use your information as set out in this notice and we will only
        share your information with third parties for commercial purposes such
        as marketing or promotions if we have your consent to do so; or where
        we've engaged a company outside PakiTours to provide a service for us
        (which might involve them handling your information, but this is only
        when we have proper safeguards in place); or where we're obliged by law
        to share information with authorities.
      </p>
      <h3>When you give us information</h3>
      <p>
        You sometimes give us information like your name, email address, phone
        number, and/or postal address. You might also give us information about
        yourself such as your favorite places to go and profile photo as part of
        creating a profile with PakiTours. We use this information to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          receive and reply to feedback and queries from you (see our note on
          feedback below)
        </li>
        <li>
          receive and process orders from our online shop and provide technical
          support if you're having trouble receiving your order
        </li>
        <li>
          personalize or improve the way our products and content are presented
          to you
        </li>
        <li>
          where you specifically ask us to, we'll send you emails containing
          travel and product information, third-party offers chosen by us from
          our commercial, surveys, contests and advertisements. You can
          unsubscribe any time using the unsubscribe link at the end of all
          emails.
        </li>
        <li>
          share related information with relevant parties/business partners to
          serve you better
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Except where we are relying on your consent, or fulfilling some aspect
        of a contract with you (which will include not only purchases and
        competition entries, but may also include administration of your account
        or related feedback or queries), we will be processing your data in
        these ways - including for marketing purposes - because we believe it is
        in our legitimate interests to do so.
      </p>
      <h4>Feedbacks and errors:</h4>

        <span>Right to request access </span>- you can ask us what information
        we hold about you and check that we are complying with the laws that
        apply to the way we use your information. We won't charge you a fee for
        this, unless you ask for excessive information or you repeatedly contact
        us or you don't have a proper reason to contact us. If you make repeat
        requests or we don't believe you have a proper reason for asking us, we
        might refuse your request. We might ask you for more information about
        yourself so that we can make sure you are who you say you are before

        correct or update it. If we think the information is actually correct,
        we will tell you why. While we are assessing whether or not the
        information is incorrect or incomplete we will restrict the information.
        If we have provided incorrect or incomplete information about you to
        someone else, we will request that they also update your information
        following your request.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <span>Right to request deletion (“right to be forgotten”) </span>- in

        information:
      </p>
      <ul>

          collected it
        </li>
        <li>
          if we asked you for consent to use your information, but you want to
          withdraw that consent
        </li>
        <li>
          if you object to our use of your personal information and there is no
          legitimate business interest for us to keep using it
        </li>
        <li>where we're using your information against the law</li>
        <li>
          where there is a legal obligation that means your information has to

        unlawful. When we receive any objection to processing on these grounds,
        we will generally restrict access to the information you've contacted us
        about while we assess whether our legitimate interests are lawful and
        override your objection. If we can demonstrate that our lawful reasons
        override your objection or that we need to keep your information for
        legal claims, we are allowed to continue to process your personal
        information. Otherwise we will either restrict processing of your
        information or stop processing it altogether.

        provided information to us with your consent, you have the right to
        request that we provide your information to you, or to someone else, in
        a commonly used electronic form. We will not charge you for the transfer
        of your information unless your request is excessive. Also, we have to
        protect other people's personal information which means that we may have
        to remove some information before transferring your information.

        processing of your personal information. Alternatively, if you'd like to
        unsubscribe from one of our emails, you can simply go to the
